Verify that the CPLD is present and found:

./openFPGALoader -c libgpiod --pins 10:8:11:9 --detect

Write the programming file cp_pi_if.jed. For a -10 speed grade CPLD you use:

./openFPGALoader -c libgpiod --pins 10:8:11:9 -f cp_pi_if-10.jed

...and likewise for a -5 speedgrade you use:

./openFPGALoader -c libgpiod --pins 10:8:11:9 -f cp_pi_if-10.jed

There is no jed file prepared for the -7 speed. You may try either of the above, and if they don't work - PM me, and I'll see what I can muster up :)
